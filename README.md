# Prerequisites

- [x] ASP.Net Core 2.0

# Docker

Run `sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144` if elastic search cannot start because of out of memory exceptions.

Run `docker ps` confirm the container is up....

Run `dotnet run` to start our project...

# Setup and use Kibana(our log visualization tool)

1. Open in your favorite browser the following URL: http://localhost:5601

2. The first thing to do is to configure the index pattern before you can start using the goodies in the Kibana web application.

i.e logstash-* and @timestamp.

3. After the index pattern is configured then you can click on the Discover menu option to see each of the logging information generated by the web requests you have created.
